# Body Temperature Monitoring System

The Body Temperature Monitoring System is a project developed to implement the SRUM methodology. It was created as part of the Agile Project Administration subject at the Universidad Popular Aut√≥noma del Estado de Puebla.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a system capable of measuring body temperature and recording it in a way that allows patients to monitor their health status. Key features include:

- **Temperature Measurement:** The system enables the measurement of body temperature and provides feedback to users, indicating whether they have a fever.
- **Data Visualization:** Patients can visualize their temperature history through graphs and tables, allowing them to track changes over the past 7 days.
- **User Roles:** The system supports multiple user roles, including Patients, Doctors, Admins, and Super Admins. Each role has specific privileges for account management and data access.
